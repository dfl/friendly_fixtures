FriendlyFixtures
================

This plugin is a simple extension to add some cool features to the fixtures macro in Test::Unit.

It enables you to:
* load dependent models, which are found by object introspection on a model's ActiveRecord associations.
* assert that all the loaded fixtures are valid. This can be very helpful in finding bugs.

== Example Usage:

class SomeTest < Test::Unit::TestCase
  fixtures :user, :dependencies => true, :validate => true
end
